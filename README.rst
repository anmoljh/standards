Galaxy Tool Development Standards and Best Practices
======================================================================

With the extensive efforts developers from the IUC have put into
developing tools over the years, we have tried to come up with some best
practices that we would recommend to the community for their use. Both
for contributing back to
`IUC repository <https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/>`__ and for use in
their own tool repositories.

You can read these Best Practices at `readthedocs <http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
